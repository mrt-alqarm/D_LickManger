### 2. AWS Deployment with Enhanced Security

#### Option A: AWS Elastic Beanstalk (Recommended for Medium Security)

1. **Create Elastic Beanstalk Application**
   ```bash
   # Install EB CLI
   pip install awsebcli
   
   # Initialize EB application
   eb init
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   eb setenv NODE_ENV=production
   ```

3. **Enable Enhanced Health Reporting**
   - In AWS Console: Configuration → Monitoring → Enhanced health reporting

4. **Configure Load Balancer for HTTPS**
   - In AWS Console: Configuration → Load Balancer
   - Add HTTPS listener with SSL certificate

#### Option B: AWS ECS with Fargate (Recommended for High Security)

1. **Create ECR Repository**
   ```bash
   aws ecr create-repository --repository-name link-manager
   ```

2. **Build and Push Docker Image**
   ```bash
   # Login to ECR
   aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin [account-id].dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
   
   # Build and push
   docker build -t link-manager .
   docker tag link-manager:latest [account-id].dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/link-manager:latest
   docker push [account-id].dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/link-manager:latest
   ```

3. **Create ECS Task Definition with Security**
   ```json
   {
     "family": "link-manager",
     "networkMode": "awsvpc",
     "requiresCompatibilities": ["FARGATE"],
     "cpu": "256",
     "memory": "512",
     "executionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::[account-id]:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole",
     "containerDefinitions": [
       {
         "name": "link-manager",
         "image": "[account-id].dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/link-manager:latest",
         "portMappings": [
           {
             "containerPort": 3000,
             "protocol": "tcp"
           }
         ],
         "environment": [
           {
             "name": "NODE_ENV",
             "value": "production"
           }
         ],
         "logConfiguration": {
           "logDriver": "awslogs",
           "options": {
             "awslogs-group": "/ecs/link-manager",
             "awslogs-region": "us-east-1",
             "awslogs-stream-prefix": "ecs"
